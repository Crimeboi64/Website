    <h1>Final Speech</h1>
 <p>Hello everyone,
So tomorrow I have my BIG BIG EXAM and will not be at tomorrow's meeting. I almost wish I could pay the MILLIONS not to go just so I could say goodbye to you all except I'm so POOR AND BROKE AND POOR; I might as well starting eating gravel for breakfast. No Mataias, I cannot simply skip BIG TEST and abscond with my debts to the INSTITUTION. Hopefully the Pope, T Dawg, and Don Pollo, are there to be in charge tomorrow.<br>
Either way, thank you all for quite a successful year in COOLEST CLUB EVER. Especially getting second at LARGE PLANTAION, which was a mythical pull considering we were three buzzer KOs and four paper rollings from being ejected out of OPPOSING FARMLAND. Besides that I had some of the most entertaining moments this year at scholar bowl, too many to list. My favorite part of the year was when me and LARGE GOAT MAN held free and fair elections (North Korea Style). Most importantly thank you all for showing up and thank you GREAT TEACHER MAN for letting us ABUSE your room at lunch.<br>
Try not to let THE COOLEST CLUB EVER be boring. I hope you guys will have/(already had) as much fun as I did.<br>
Thank you,<br>
Alwx<br>

    <h1>Final Speech</h1>
 <p>Hello everyone,<br>
    <br>So tomorrow I have my AICE European History exam and will not be at tomorrow's meeting. I almost wish I could pay the 140$ not to go just so I could say goodbye to you all except I'm so broke I might as well starting eating gravel for breakfast. No matthew, I cannot simply skip AICE Euro and abscond with my debts to the school. Hopefully Pope T Dawg and Don Pollo are there to be in charge tomorrow.<br>
    <br>Either way, thank you all for quite a successful year in scholar bowl. Especially getting second at districts, which was a mythical pull considering we were three buzzer KOs and four paper rollings from being ejected out of Aubrey. Besides that I had some of the most entertaining moments this year at scholar bowl, too many to list. My favorite part of the year was when me and Isidor held free and fair elections (North Korea Style). Most importantly thank you all for showing up and thank you Hansen for letting us (ab)use your room at lunch.<br>
    <br>Try not to let scholar be boring. I hope you guys will have/already had as much fun as I did.<br>
    <br>Thank you,
    <br>Alwx
 </p>
